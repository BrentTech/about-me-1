        <h1>About Becca</h1>

        <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
        <p>
            Nice to meet you! My name's Becca and I'm a Seattle-based JavaScript student and tech marketer.
            I'm a voracious learner who loves to translate my knowledge and intuition into thoughtful coding and marketing strategies.
            When I'm not working, you can find me cuddling cats, baking pies, eating ice cream, playing pinball, getting excited about neighborhood dogs, going on hikes, and watching pro wrestling (but you already know some of that from our Q & A fun!). 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I'm excited to be learning JavaScript and looking forward to having enough mastery to be able to help others learn. All in good time!
        </p>
